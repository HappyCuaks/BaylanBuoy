# BaylanBuoy
This repository provides the implementation of electronics and firmware meant to be inside a buoy. The buoy activates when a magnet is approached to the electronics. Once activated, the buoy will start retrieving its own GPS location and, once it has found its coordinates, the GSM module will be sending an SMS with the current location.
